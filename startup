#ROOM
3002
Central Aetherial Altar~
At the chapel's heart, this crystalline plinth hums with bio-lumen light, where the four elements entwine in a perpetual vortex. Here, thou standest amid swirling winds, crackling flames, flowing waters, and unyielding earth. Pasua Clerics may channel divine energy to cast commune (as the spell, once per day per character) to seek guidance from the Lords. Encounter: A lingering Deceiver illusion (Will save DC 18) tests the faithful, or a Druid's Wild Shape ritual summons an elemental guardian (CR 3) for aid in quests. Tie-in: Bards inspire Kin unity (+2 morale bonus to allies' saves for 1 hour after a Perform check DC 20).
